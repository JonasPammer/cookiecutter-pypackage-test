== Features

== System Requirements

* Python 3.7 / PyPy 3.7 or above

== Installing

This package is available at https://pypi.org/project/test_application[PyPi].

I recommend you to install using https://github.com/pypa/pipx[pipx] -
a tool that helps installing and running end-user applications written in Python
without worrying about any virtualenv magic:

----
$ pipx install test_application
----

But you can of course also install it using normal pip or in your virtual environment:

----
$ python3 -m pip install test_application
----


== Usage
